            <b>Your Content.</b> You may provide input to the Services
            (“Input”), and receive output from the Services based on the Input

            artificial intelligence generally, output may not be unique and
            other users may receive similar output from our Services. Our
            assignment above does not extend to other users’ output or any Third
            Party Output.{" "}

            our models, you can opt out by emailing a request to opt out to
            privacyataskina@gmail.com. Please note that in some cases this may

            <b>Accuracy.</b> Artificial intelligence and machine learning are
            rapidly evolving fields of study. We are constantly working to
            improve our Services to make them more accurate, reliable, safe, and
            beneficial. Given the probabilistic nature of machine learning, use
            of our Services may, in some situations, result in Output that does
            not accurately reflect real people, places, or facts.
          </p>
          <p>When you use our Services you understand and agree:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Output may not always be accurate. You should not rely on Output
              from our Services as a sole source of truth or factual
              information, or as a substitute for professional advice.

            <li>
              You must not use any Output relating to a person for any purpose
              that could have a legal or material impact on that person, such as
              making credit, educational, employment, housing, insurance, legal,
              medical, or other important decisions about them.

            <li>
              Our Services may provide incomplete, incorrect, or offensive
              Output that does not represent our views. If Output references any
              third party products or services, it doesn’t mean the third party
              endorses or is affiliated with us.

            a year. If we do, we will provide you with advance notice.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Appeals.</b> If you believe we have suspended or terminated your
            account in error, you can file an appeal with us by contacting us at

          <p>
            OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED
            BY LAW, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES
            (EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO THE
            SERVICES, AND DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
            WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
            SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY
            WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR TRADE USAGE. WE
            DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ACCURATE OR
            ERROR FREE, OR THAT ANY CONTENT WILL BE SECURE OR NOT LOST OR
            ALTERED.{" "}
          </p>

          <p>
            YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE THAT ANY USE OF OUTPUTS FROM OUR SERVICE IS AT
            YOUR SOLE RISK AND YOU WILL NOT RELY ON OUTPUT AS A SOLE SOURCE OF
            TRUTH OR FACTUAL INFORMATION, OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL
            ADVICE.
          </p>

          <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>
            NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS WILL BE LIABLE FOR
            ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY
            DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, OR
            DATA OR OTHER LOSSES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
            POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THESE
            TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE LIMITATIONS IN
            THIS SECTION APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
            APPLICABLE LAW.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some countries and states do not allow the disclaimer of certain
            warranties or the limitation of certain damages, so some or all of
            the terms above may not apply to you, and you may have additional
            rights. In that case, these Terms only limit our responsibilities to
            the maximum extent permissible in your country of residence.
          </p>
          <p>
            OUR AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND DISTRIBUTORS ARE INTENDED
            THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF THIS SECTION.
          </p>

          <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Informal Dispute Resolution.</b> We would like to understand and
            try to address your concerns prior to formal legal action. Before
            either of us files a claim against the other, we both agree to try
            to resolve the Dispute informally. You agree to do so by sending us
            notice to privacyataskina@gmail.com. We will do so by sending you
            notice to the email address associated with your account. If we are
            unable to resolve a Dispute within 60 days, either of us has the
            right to initiate arbitration. We also both agree to attend an
            individual settlement conference if either party requests one during
            this time. Any statute of limitations will be tolled during this
            informal resolution process.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Governing Law.</b> New York law will govern all disputes arising
            out of or relating to these terms or any related Services,
            regardless of conflict of laws rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Forum Selection.</b> These disputes will be resolved exclusively
            in the federal or state courts of New York County, New York, USA,
            and you and the Company consent to personal jurisdiction in those
            courts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVERS</b>. You and the Company
            agree that Disputes must be brought on an individual basis only, and
            may not be brought as a plaintiff or class member in any purported
            class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. Class actions and
            representative actions are prohibited. Only individual relief is
            available. This does not prevent either party from participating in
            a class-wide settlement. You and the Company knowingly and
            irrevocably waive any right to trial by jury in any action,
            proceeding, or counterclaim.
          </p>

            Terms or our Services accordingly from time to time. For example, we

          <p>
            We will give you at least 30 days advance notice of changes to these
            Terms that materially adversely impact you either via email or an
            in-product notification. All other changes will be effective as soon
            as we post them to our website. If you do not agree to the changes,
            you must stop using our Services.

          <p>
            <b>Delay in Enforcing These Terms.</b> Our failure to enforce a
            provision is not a waiver of our right to do so later. Except as
            provided in the dispute resolution section above, if any portion of
            these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, that
            portion will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and it
            will not affect the enforceability of any other terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Trade Controls.</b> You must comply with all applicable trade
            laws, including sanctions and export control laws. Our Services may
